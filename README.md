## Speech to Text Converters

This repository features two implementations of speech-to-text converters in React: one using the `react-speech-recognition` library and the other using the Web Speech API. Both components offer real-time conversion of spoken words into text with easy-to-use start and stop controls, displaying both interim and final transcripts for enhanced user experience. The `react-speech-recognition` implementation leverages a popular library for seamless integration, while the Web Speech API implementation provides a lightweight, native approach. Both components are designed for reusability and can be easily integrated into future projects, offering flexibility and ease of customization.It's important to note that React Speech Recognition internally leverages the Web Speech API for its functionality.
